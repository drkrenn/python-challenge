The assignment can be found withinthe script files main.py inside of the folders PYBank and PYPoll.  
Having gotten behind after a hospitalization at the end of week 2, I had a bit of a hard time catching up at the beginning of the python introduction. 
As such, I had to rely on a lot of help from the learning assistants, especially on the PYBank assignment. 
Some of the looping code was the result of some starter code that was provided to me by one of the assistants. 
I also needed some assistance from them on developing the net change list. 
The remaineder of the code, including the print code and calculational code was self-generated with no outside sources copied. 

For the second half of the assignment (PYPoll), the majority of the code was recycled from the first part of the assignment (PYBank) or was self-generated. 
The one exception was the creation of the syntax to develop the candidate list. 
No code was directly given to me, but I did work with a learning assistant to get that code set up correctly.
